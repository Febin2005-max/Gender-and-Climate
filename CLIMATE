    <h2>What is Gender Equality?</h2>
    <p>Gender equality refers to the state where individuals of all genders have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. It is a fundamental human right that aims to overcome stereotypes and promote fairness in social, political, and economic spheres.</p>

    <h2>Causes of Gender Inequality</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patriarchal Society:</strong> Traditional norms that prioritize men over women.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Education:</strong> Limited access to education for women and girls leads to fewer opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Dependency:</strong> Women are often economically dependent on men, reducing their autonomy.</li>
        <li><strong>Discriminatory Laws:</strong> Legal systems that discriminate based on gender reinforce inequality.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Effects of Gender Inequality</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Economic Growth:</strong> When women are restricted from full participation in the economy, overall growth is hindered.</li>
        <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> Women, especially in marginalized communities, are more likely to live in poverty due to inequality.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Disparities:</strong> Unequal access to healthcare services affects women's and girls' health globally.</li>
        <li><strong>Violence:</strong> Gender-based violence is a direct consequence of unequal power relations.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
